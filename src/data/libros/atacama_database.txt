Abstract The Atacama Desert is one of the oldest
and driest places on Earth. In the last decade,
microbial richness and diversity has been acknowledged as an important biological resource of this
region. Owing to the value of the microbial diversity
apparent in potential biotechnology applications and
conservation purposes, it is necessary to catalogue
these microbial communities to promote research
activities and help to preserve the wide range of
ecological niches of the Atacama region. A prototype
Atacama Database has been designed and it provides a
description of the rich microbial diversity of the
Atacama Desert, and helps to visualise available

literature resources. Data has been collected, curated,
and organised into several categories to generate a
single record for each organism in the database that
covers classification, isolation metadata, morphology,
physiology, genome and metabolism information. The
current version of Atacama Database contains 2302
microorganisms and includes cultured and uncultured
organisms retrieved from different environments
within the desert between 1984 and 2016. These
organisms are distributed in bacterial, archaeal or
eukaryotic domains, along with those that are unclassified taxonomically. The initial prototype of the
Atacama Database includes a basic search and taxonomic and advanced search tools to allow identification and comparison of microbial populations, and
space distribution within this biome. A geolocation
search was implemented to visualise the microbial
diversity of the ecological niches defined by sectors
and extract general information of the sampling sites.
This effort will aid understanding of the microbial
ecology of the desert, microbial population dynamics,
seasonal behaviour, impact of climate change over
time, and reveal further biotechnological applications
of these microorganisms. The Atacama Database is

Introduction
The Atacama Desert is located in the north of Chile
from 19°S to 30°S along the Pacific coast of South
America and from east to west extending from the
Andean Cordillera to the coast. It encompasses
105,000 sq km with an altitude ranging from sea level
to over 3500 m above (Dorador 2007; Azua-Bustos
et al. 2017; Bull et al. 2018). Arid conditions in the
region date back 150 million years making this desert
one of the oldest and driest places on earth (Hartley
et al. 2005; Clarke 2006). The Atacama Desert
exhibits semi-arid to extreme hyper-arid environments
that are characterised by low water availability and
variable levels of organic carbon content. The ecological niches of the zone are very diverse comprising
sectors with conditions considered to be at the dry
limit for life (Connon et al. 2007; Schulze-Makuch
et al. 2018), caves in the Coastal range, geyser fields,
and the high Andean plateau (Altiplano) where
different water bodies with a wide range of salinity
(from freshwater to saturated saltwater), and peatland
(bofedales) can be found (Demergasso et al.
2004, 2010; Dorador et al. 2013). It is notable that
several of these sectors are extremely sensitive to
climate change and anthropogenic disturbances (Bull
et al. 2016). For decades, the Atacama Desert has been
known as a rich resource of minerals with an intense
mining activity present in the region and heavy use of
natural resources for those purposes, especially water
extraction (Scheihing and Tröger 2018). During the
last decade, microbiological research has grown
substantially in this hyper-arid desert covering different topics from microbial diversity and ecology
studies to biogeochemistry and Mars-like environments as shown in Fig. 1 (Bull et al. 2016). Thanks to
these research efforts and their findings, the microbial
richness and diversity of the Atacama Desert is
evident. In general, these studies establish what
microbes are present, what type of niches they
colonise and the tolerance mechanisms to extreme
physical and chemical conditions, amongst others
(Azua-Bustos et al. 2012; Bull et al. 2016; Idris et al.
2017a; Pérez et al. 2017; Schulze-Makuch et al. 2018).
Bioprospecting studies of microorganisms isolated
from the extremely arid zone of the Atacama have
shown promising results with the isolation of novel
species, and new chemical structures with biological
activity such as antibiotics and anticancer agents

123

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2020) 113:185–195

(Schulz et al. 2011; Santhanam et al. 2012a, b; Idris
et al. 2017b; Wichner et al. 2017). Indeed, several new
Streptomyces strains have been isolated and described.
For example, Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii produces
previously described metabolites, but also synthesises
novel antibiotics, chaxamycins and chaxalactins, and
chaxapeptin (Elsayed et al. 2015; Gomez-Escribano
et al. 2015; Castro et al. 2018). At present, specialised
metabolite producers are of particular interest to help
with the growing problem of antimicrobial resistant
strains (Mohammadipanah and Wink 2016). In addition, many studies have been carried out in the arid
region of the Atacama Desert since it has been
compared to Mars soil, with increased attention on
astrobiology applications (Navarro-Gonzalez 2003;
Davila and Schulze-Makuch 2016; Azua-Bustos et al.
2018).
The microbial diversity of the Atacama Desert is of
great importance due to its current and potential
biotechnological applications. It is important to highlight their functional role regarding trophic web
interactions (Dorador et al. 2018), C and N biogeochemical cycles (Thiel et al. 2010; Molina et al.
2018a) and greenhouse gas production (Molina et al.
2018b). Previous studies have demonstrated the high
microbial diversity in different habitats of the Atacama Desert independent of the applied technique
(Demergasso et al. 2004; Dorador et al. 2013; Idris
et al. 2017a). Therefore, a catalogue of these microbial
communities is necessary to promote its diversity,
protect these endemic resources and their environment, and as an educational resource about the value
of these microorganisms. These microbial communities are important natural resources whose environment is mostly without protection. For instance, there
is no protection for areas of the core of the hyper-arid
desert that are known to be vulnerable to perturbation
by mining, recreational (e.g. Rally) and other activities. Most of the microbial diversity of the Atacama
Desert has been described from either the hyper-arid
desert or high altitude saline wetlands (locally called
‘salares’), some of which are included in national
reserves and national parks. To obtain samples from
protected areas it is imperative to have permission
from CONAF (National Forest Corporation, Ministry
of Agriculture) following strict regulations. Some of
these areas are managed by local indigenous communities (e.g. Atacameños). The area covered by the
database described here includes some protected areas

such as Los Flamencos National Reserve (Salar de
Atacama, Salar de Tara, Salar de Pujsa) and Llullaillaco National Park. Nevertheless, most of the microbiological studies performed in the Atacama Desert
have been carried out in unprotected areas. Furthermore, the knowledge about microbial diversity of
these ecosystems is mostly unknown to the local and
national community.
Over the past 20 years, several efforts have been
made to create microbial diversity databases to
promote the understanding of microbial communities
within the context of their habitats (Stoner et al. 2001;
Majhi et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2013). Stoner et al. (2001)
were pioneers with their development of The Yellowstone Microbial Database and Map server. This
database integrates microbiological data with environmental, geographical and ecological data to
improve the understanding of the microbial communities and provides a scheme to implement maps of
microbial diversity. Using these previous studies as a
base, the prototype Atacama Database seeks to make
visible the microbiological research done in the region
during the last 50 years in order to value and preserve
the unique and native microbial diversity of the
Atacama Desert. It compiles the published resources
available to facilitate information retrieval from
primary literature to create a comprehensive source
of microbial information. The prototype Atacama
Database currently houses data relating to 2302
strains. These organisms include archaea, bacteria,
fungi, microalgae, and taxonomically unidentified

microorganisms. Data stored have an emphasis on
taxonomic and isolation metadata information. Morphology, physiology, genome and metabolism information were included in the cases in which these data
were available. Data were collected from open access
sources and articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Data were processed and stored in a document
storage system built using MongoDB (https://www.
mongodb.com/). The current version of the Atacama
Database Platform includes tools to access the data
such as a quick search by typing entries and taxonomic
and advance search tools where filters can be used to
identify specific microorganisms. A geolocation
search was implemented to help with the visualisation
of ecological niches and extract physical and chemical
parameters of the sampling sites. When this database
is fully developed, it will help to promote the study of
the microbial ecology of the desert, microbial population dynamics, biogeography, seasonal behaviour,
impact of climate change over time, and reveal further
biotechnological
applications
of
local
microorganisms.

Materials and methods
Data sources and database structure
The Atacama Database contains information from
literature sources including more than 100 publications and open access sources such as the US National

123

188

Library of Medicine (Pubmed) (NCBI Resource
Coordinators 2017), and Genomes Online Database
(GOLD) (Bernal et al. 2001). Links to external
databases were added to facilitate access to primary
data. By the end of March 2018, the Atacama Database
contained information on 2302 organisms isolated
from 135 different sampling sites. The sampling sites
cover diverse ecological niches from lakes and foggy
sites to extreme and hyper-arid desert areas ranging
from 0 to 5916 [m above sea level]. The data collected
are continually evolving, but preliminary statistics
show that the catalogue includes representatives of 32
phyla, 50 classes, 75 orders, 90 families, 104 genera
and 70 species. To date, the number of validly named
species isolated from the Atacama Desert is low and a
general taxonomic rank is usually provided in most of
the published studies. The number of microorganisms
associated with each phylum present in the catalogue
is shown in Fig. 2a.
Data were collected, curated and organised into six
main categories: taxonomy, isolation metadata, morphology, physiology, genome and metabolism. These
categories encompass the major characteristics of
these organisms and the available information has
been added to each respective attribute. Taxonomy
includes information related to general classification,
NCBI taxonomy ID, accession numbers to different
databases and literature information. Isolation metadata provides information such as isolation environment, environment features, sample type, collection
site, geographical location (latitude and longitude in
decimal format), altitude and physical and chemical
characteristics of the sample and/or sites. Morphology
describes cell size, cell shape, motility and spore
morphology while the physiology section provides
growth requirements such as pH and O2 requirements.
The data related to genomes includes genomic features
such as genome size and digital DNA G ? C composition. Metabolic products data associated with pharmacological/biotechnological applications has been
included such as compound type and PubChem
Compound ID (CID). Figure 2b shows the available
data for each category.
A single record was generated for each organism
where a unique Organism ID was assigned to each
organism to link all its attributes in a Microsoft Excel
Open XML Format Spreadsheet file (XLSX file
extension). This file includes a reference for metabolic
information that was saved in a separate XLSX file.

123

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2020) 113:185–195

Relevant geographic areas were stored in a similar
way. Data were processed with an application developed in Java programming language, which stores it in
a document database system using MongoDB. The
platform was built using a Web Service Layer (API
REST architecture), the back-end was implemented
using Golang programming language (https://golang.
org/) and the front-end was built using a JavaScript
framework (Vue.js framework (https://vuejs.org/)) to
visualise the data. Geolocation was implemented with
the help of the Google Maps JavaScript API (https://
developers.google.com/maps/). Several indexes were
constructed with the stored documents to allow taxonomic, advanced, and geographic searches in an efficient and scalable way. Figure 3a summarises the
organisation of data and database structure in the
Atacama Database and Fig. 3b shows the internal
structure of data saved in the database.

Results and discussion
Database features
The prototype version of Atacama Database offers
access to a catalogue of microorganisms of the
Atacama Desert through a web interface. It was
implemented using a non-structured database where
data was stored using a document-oriented approach
in MongoDB and the Vue.js JavaScript framework for
interacting with the data. This configuration allows
scalability and easy modification of fields or attributes
of the information. Currently, the data present in this
database has an emphasis on taxonomic and isolation
metadata and specific information about each organism is continually added as it becomes available. The
Atacama Database homepage gives easy access to the
main querying options: basic search, taxonomy tree
search, advanced search, and geolocation search.
Graphs with the distribution of organisms by domain
and phylum, and by the different levels of the
phylogenetic tree, are provided to reflect the diversity
of the organisms in the database and acquisition of
data into Atacama Database. The Atacama Database
gives support for users that require assistance or would
like to submit suggestions about the data after
registration. Registration is free and gives access to
the Database content. Additionally, a brief tutorial is
included in the Help section.

for organisms with specific characteristics. The
Database can be explored by taxa classification
(domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus and
species); collection site features such as isolation
environment, environment feature, sample type; and
strains with specific characteristics such as type strain,
Gram stain, oxygen requirements, and metabolic
products. Results are listed by organism ID and
description. Specific microorganism data can be

accessed using the display format described above.
An overview of the query results can be retrieved in

Geolocation search
Since the Atacama Desert has many different ecological niches, a geolocation search was implemented to
display organisms by their sample collection sites data

using Google Maps JavaScript API. Organisms are
grouped by polygons and markers in the Atacama
Desert map. The search by polygons is defined by
thirty-five areas that include salt lakes (salares), lakes,
lagoons and volcanoes among others. Table 1 summarises the geolocations available in the database.
These areas were selected since they cluster the prime
collection sites. Areas are highlighted and listed on the
map to facilitate selection, location and retrieval of
information. A description of the areas and a list with
the organisms associated with each sector are provided. On the other hand, information on latitude and
longitude was used to display collection site locations
by markers on the map. An example of the geolocation
search is shown in Fig. 4.
Future steps
Since 2000, several Microbial Observatory projects
have established to help and support research into
microbial communities over time and across environmental gradients. These observatories have had a key
role in the study and understanding of microbial
diversity (Countway et al. 2010; Edgcomb et al. 2011;
Cardace et al. 2013) and in efforts to describe new
species of bacteria and archaea. Although the Atacama
Database is still in the early stages of development,
this project provides a preliminary interface to
describe the phylogenetic diversity derived from the
Atacama Desert and compile a library of the primary
literature. The Database will continue to grow and
information related to proteins, genes and metabolic
pathways will be incorporated in the next stages. Also,
the Geolocation search tool will be improved to
include additional information related to the environmental and geological context. Isolation metadata
provides data from published studies and it includes
general information such as sample type, sample
collection date, collection site information and physical and chemical properties of the sites. However, this
data is scarce or not always available. Additional data
related to the geological and geochemical habitats will
help the study of ecosystems, microbial population
dynamics and seasonal behaviour.
The current version of Atacama Database is mainly
directed to the academic sector. A public version of
Atacama Database is being developed to reach the
general community since it is important to educate the

193

public about the value of these endemic resources and
the necessity of protecting their environment.

Conclusions
Many studies have been done in the arid region of the
Atacama Desert with the first findings of bacterial
presence dating back to the 19600 s (Cameron et al.
1966), but in general the information is sparse and did
not reveal the complexity of this ecosystem. Despite
the growing interest in the microbiology of the
Atacama Desert, there is a low number of validly
named microbial species that have been first isolated
from the Atacama. In this study, a platform for the
valorisation of the microbial diversity of the Atacama
Desert was developed. The Atacama Database will
help to promote research, provide a comprehensive
data collection of the Atacama Desert microorganisms
and find further biotechnology applications for its
microorganisms.
